# ðŸ”¥Mojoâ€Š-â€ŠBuild a simple MLP neural network in the fastest programming language

Considering that Modular Inc has created a new programming language named mojo, which is faster than Python by 68000x and 5000x compared to SCALAR C++, today I would like to present a simple way to write from scratch a basic Multi-Layer Perceptron along with forward propagation and backward error propagation using stochastic gradient descent.Â 
This is my interpretation of the problem, where I focused on understanding the conventions of the mojo language, building its data structures, and the low-level mechanisms of this language. The program was written based on Mojo released in October 2023.
